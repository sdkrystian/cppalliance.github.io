  Libc++, where I am the “code owner”
  WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG)
  Boost
  Speaking at conferences


Lots of work these month(s) behind the scenes, getting stuff ready for C++20, LLVM 9, and Boost 1.71.0.

Libc++

The LLVM 9.0 release has shipped!  The release date was 19-September, a few days later than planned. There are a lot of new libc++ features in the release.

As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.

Many times, bug reports are based on misunderstandings, but require a couple of hours of work in order to figure out where the misunderstanding lies.

We’re working on a major redesign of the “debug mode” for libc++, after we realized that the existing (not widely used) debug mode is useless when you’re trying to do things at compile (constexpr) time.

I have been spending a lot of time the last few weeks working on the calendaring stuff in &lt;chrono&gt;, specifically the interface with the OS for getting time zone information. It is a surprisingly complicated task. Fortunately for me, I have a friend who has been down this road in the past, and is willing to answer questions.

LWG issues resolved in libc++ (almost certainly incomplete)


  LWG3296	Add a missing default parameter to regex::assign


LLVM features implemented (almost certainly incomplete)


  P1466	Parts of P1466 “Misc Chrono fixes” more to come here.


LLVM bugs resolved (definitely incomplete)


  
    Bug 42918	Fix thread comparison by making sure we never pass our special ‘not a thread’ value to the underlying implementation
  
  
    Bug 43063	Fix a couple of unguarded operator, calls in algorithm
  
  
    Bug 43034	Add a missing _VSTD:: before a call to merge.
  
  
    Bug 43300	Add a missing _VSTD:: Only initialize the streams cout/wcout/cerr/wcerr etc once, rather than any time Init::Init is called
  


Other interesting LLVM bits from (certainly incomplete)


  Revision 368299 Implement hh_mm_ss from P1466. Part of the ongoing &lt;chrono&gt; implementation work.

WG21

We shipped a CD out of Cologne in July. Now we wait for the National Bodies (members of ISO, aka “NBs”) to review the draft and send us comments. When we’ve resolved all of these comments, we will send the revised draft out for balloting. If the NBs approve, then that draft will become C++20.

The next WG21 meeting will be November 2-8 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
This will be the first of two meetings that are focused on resolving NB comments; the second one will be in Prague in February.

I have several “clean-up” papers for the Belfast mailing. The mailing deadline is a week from Monday (5-October), so I need to finish them up.


  P1718R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 25 - Algorithms library
  P1719R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 26 - Numerics library
  P1720R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 28 - Localization library
  P1721R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 29 - Input/Output library
  P1722R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 30 - Regular Expression library
  P1723R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 31 - Atomics library


We polled the NBs before Cologne, and they graciously agreed to have these changes made post-CD.

Boost

Boost 1.71.0 was released on 19-August. Micheal Caisse was the release manager, with some help from me.

As part of the Boost Community maintenance team, I (and others) made many changes to libraries whose authors are no longer able (or interested) in maintaining them.

I have a couple of suggestions for additions to the Boost.Algorithms library that I will be working on in the near future.

Conferences

I was a speaker at CppCon last week. I gave a new talk “std::midpoint - How hard could it be?” (no link yet) which was quite well received. I got a few questions that will require additional research, and may improve my implementation.

I also participated in the “Committee Fireside Chat”, at CppCon, where conference members get to ask questions of the committee members who are present.

Upcoming talks:

  LLVM Developer’s Conference is in San Jose in October. I will not be speaking, but I will be moderating the lightning talks.
  C++ Russia is at the end of October in St. Petersburg.
  ACCU Autumn is right after the WG21 meeting in early November.
  Meeting C++ is in mid-November in Berlin.


I will be making the “Fall 2019 C++ European Tour”, going from St. Petersburg to Belfast to Berlin before heading home mid-November.

          <p class='text-xxs'>Boost.Beast

I’ve started working on improvements to the zlib part of Beast. There are some gaps
in the test harness of these components, so I’ve decided to increase coverage.
As a first step, I started porting test cases from the original zlib library’s tests,
to verify that existing code matches the expected behavior of the original library.
Fortunately, I’ve not found any significant discrepancies, there’s only one issue
where Beast rejects malformed input for the wrong reason (I’m still looking into it
whether it’s actually an issue at the time of writing this).

I’ve also looked into providing more meaningful feedback from test failures in Beast,
especially when they’re run in CI. While the current test framework does print
a line number on failure, the line number is often in a function template that’s called
by multiple test cases, which makes it quite hard to determine which test failed
just from the log, often requiring the use of a debugger. Doing that locally
may not be a problem, but it’s significantly harder in CI, so I’ve decided to
try to use Boost Stacktrace to provide a callstack on each failure in Beast tests.
Additionally, I’ve also worked on running the test suite without OpenSSL installed,
to hopefully fix some of the failures in the official Boost test matrix.

The question of Networking TS and TLS

There’s recently been quite a bit of discussion of networking being useless
without “secure by default” sockets. Since this is a recurring topic and I expect it to return in the future,
so I’ve decided to write up an analysis of this issue.

First of all, I believe that an attempt to deliver a “secure by default” socket
within the current networking proposal right now will result in something like
std::async - not really practically useful.

What kind of TLS facilities I’d consider useful for the average user of the standard library?
A reasonable guideline, I think, are ones I could trust to be used in a distributed
system that handles money (in any form).
Note, that TLS is not only a protocol that provides confidentiality (i.e. encryption),
but also allows verification of the identity either the server by the client, or both.
Remember, doesn’t matter if 3rd parties can’t see what you’re sending,
if you’re sending your data to the wrong peer in the first place!

While it may seem simple at first look, just verifying the identity of a peer
is an extremely complex process, as my experience with Certify has shown.
Doing it portably and efficiently with the same interface and effects is extremely difficult.
Browsers resort to all kinds of workarounds and custom solutions to be able
to securely implement just this one aspect of TLS. I attempted to implement
a library (intended for inclusion into Boost) that would perform this one aspect,
however, I found it to be impossible to provide a practical solution with
the current state of the networking ecosystem in Boost. In fact, one method
of certificate verification (via the OCSP protocol) requires a (very) basic
HTTP client. Yes, in order to perform a TLS handshake and verify the peer’s
certificate status using OCSP, you need an HTTP client.

This is just one aspect of the TLS protocol that needs to be addressed.
There are others as well - what about the basic cryptographic building blocks,
like ciphers, hashing algorithms, PRFs and so on - they are bound to be used
in a hypothetical implementation in a standard library, should they be exposed? If yes then with what interface?.
Considering that there are no standard networking facilities and not even a proposal for standard TLS,
this is a discussion that would essentially postpone standard networking indefinitely.

Finally, there’s also an opposite position that no networking should be
in the standard at all. I disagree with this position - networking has become a very important
part of many C++ projects (in my career, all C++ projects I dealt with, touched
some sort of network in one way or another).
At the very least we need standard named requirements for library compatibility, since that is
severely lacking in the ecosystem at this point.

  Libc++, where I am the “code owner”
  WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG)
  Boost
  Speaking at conferences


This month, the big news (and the big work item) was the approval of the C++ “Committee Draft” at the WG21 meeting in Cologne on July 15-20.

You can think of this as a “beta version” of the C++20 standard; all features are complete. The next step is bug fixing, with an eye towards releasing next year.

Libc++

The LLVM 9.0 release is on track for September. We have a release branch, and the RC1 was recently dropped.

Because of the run-up and the aftermath of the Cologne meeting, the libc++ accomplishments are a bit sparse this month.

As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.

LWG issues resolved this month in libc++ (almost certainly incomplete)


  LWG2273	regex_match ambiguity


LLVM features implemented this month (almost certainly incomplete)


  P1612	Relocate endian
  P1466	Parts of P1466 “Misc Chrono fixes” more to come here.

Other interesting LLVM bits from this month (certainly incomplete)


  
    Revision 365854 Reorganize the &lt;bit&gt; header to make most of the facilities available for internal use pre-C++20. NFC for external users.
  
  
    Revision 367120 Fix a bug in std::chrono::abs where it would fail when the duration’s period had not been reduced.
  
  
    Revision 364884 Add an internal call __libcpp_is_constant_evaluated, which works like std::is_constant_evaluated, except that it can be called at any language level (back to C++98). For older languages, it just returns false. This gets rid of a lot of ifdefs in the libc++ source code.

WG21

As I said above, we shipped a CD out of Cologne. Now we wait for the National Bodies (members of ISO, aka “NBs”) to review the draft and send us comments. When we’ve resolved all of these comments, we will send the revised draft out for balloting. If the NBs approve, then that draft will become C++20.

We approved many new features for C++20 in Cologne:

  P0553 - Bit Operations
  P0980 - Constexpr string
  P1004 - Constexpr vector
  P1065 - Constexpr INVOKE
  P1135 - The C++20 Synchronization Library
  P1208 - Source Location
  P0645 - Text Formatting
  P1361 - Integration of chrono with text formatting
  P1754 - Rename concepts to standard_case for C++20, while we still can
  P1614 - Spaceship integration in the Standard Library
  P0600 - Stop Tokens and a Joining Thread
  P0631 - Math Constants


We also did not approve many proposed features. Most of these were not approved because we ran out of time, rather than any fault of theirs:

  P1391 - Range constructors for string_view
  P1394 - Range constructors for span
  P0288 - any_invokable
  P0201 - polymorphic_value
  P0429 - A Standard flatmap
  P1222 - A Standard flatset
  P0533 - constexpr for cmath
  P0792 - function_ref
  P0881 - A Proposal to add stacktrace library
  P1272 - Byte-swapping
  P0627 - Function to mark unreachable code
  and many others


I still have a bunch of mechanical changes that need to be made before we ship:

  P1718R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 25 - Algorithms library
  P1719R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 26 - Numerics library
  P1720R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 28 - Localization library
  P1721R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 29 - Input/Output library
  P1722R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 30 - Regular Expression library
  P1723R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 31 - Atomics library


We polled the NBs before Cologne, and they graciously agreed to have these changes made post-CD.

Boost

The next Boost release cycle is in process; I am helping Michael Caisse as release manager with this release. We should have a release in the next couple of weeks.

Upcoming talks:

  CppCon in September in Denver.

          <p class='text-xxs'>This month I’ve been working on the following projects:

  Certify
  Boost.Beast


Certify
After quite a bit of work exploring ways to make certificate verification more complete,
I’ve concluded that Boost is currently missing a few tools to make that viable.
A comprehensive solution requires, at the very least, a functional HTTP client
able to handle higher-level semantics like redirects, proxies or compressed bodies.
While these are unlikely to happen while performing an OCSP query or downloading
a CRL set from Google’s update service, they still need to be handled, otherwise
the user will be left in a no better state than when no library is used.
At this point, Certify only offers basic verification, but that is still
simillar level to what cURL does. Providing a comprehensive solution will require
either a infrastructure solution (something like Google’s CRLsets) or
a library based one (i.e. build up all the required libraries to be able
to perform proper certificate status checks).

Boost.Beast
I’ve continued the work on expanding split compilation in Beast, by turning some
internal function templates, in websocket code, into regular functions. Additionally,
I’ve simplified the websocket prng code after proving with some benchmarks that the
previous solution made it worse both for the fast case (with TLS enabled)
and the slow one. The speed up is marginal, but it made the code much simpler
and reduced the size of binaries by small amount (a few K at best).
I’ve also worked to cleaning up some of the compilation warnings that I found
using the new Azure Piepelines CI in Beast. I also had to deal with an an odd case of
miscompilation under MSVC 14.2 (x64 Release), where the use of static_string&lt;7&gt;
failed tests with paritally garbage output while static_string&lt;8&gt; succeeded.

Libc++

The next big milestone for libc++ is the LLVM 9.0 release this summer. We’re working towards that, implementing new features and fixing bugs. The “Branch for release” is currently scheduled for July 18th.

As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.

I created a status page for the LWG issues and papers that are already set up for a vote at the Cologne WG21 meeting.

LWG issues resolved this month in libc++ (almost certainly incomplete)


  LWG2221	No formatted output operator for nullptr
  LWG3206	year_month_day conversion to sys_days uses not-existing member function


LLVM features implemented this month (almost certainly incomplete)


  P0553	Bit operations
  P0556	Integral power-of-2 operations
  P1355	Exposing a narrow contract for ceil2
  P0646	Improving the Return Value of Erase-Like Algorithms I


LLVM bugs resolved this month (probably incomplete)


  Bug 41843	std::is_base_of should give correct result for incomplete unions
  Bug 38638	Wrong constraint for std::optional&lt;T&gt;::operator=(U&amp;&amp;)
  Bug 30589	std::complex with a custom type does not work because of how std::__promote is defined
  Bug 42396	Alignment not respected in containers for over-aligned enumeration types
  Bug 28704	num_get::do_get incorrect digit grouping check
  Bug 18074	Undefined references when using pointer to member functions
  Bug 26503	std::quoted doesn’t work with char16_t or char32_t strings.
  Bug 41714	std::tuple&lt;&gt; is not trivially constructible
  Bug 36863	basic_string_view(const CharT*, size_type) constructor shouldn’t comment out assert of nullptr and length checks
  Bug 42166	to_chars can puts leading zeros on numbers


Other LLVM bits from this month (certainly incomplete)


  
    Revision 364545	Provide hashers for string_view only if they are using the default char_traits. Reported on StackOverflow
  
  
    Reworked to_string to use to_chars. Much faster, and avoids having multiple implementations. This involved reworking to_chars so that it was available back to C++03. I did all of the to_chars refactoring, but not the to_string rework.

WG21

The next WG21 meeting is July 15-20 in Cologne, Germany.

There were no WG21 meetings in June. We (LWG) held four teleconference this month, reviewing papers in advance of the July meeting, and will have another one next week.

I had seven papers in the pre-Cologne mailing:

  P1718R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 25 - Algorithms library
  P1719R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 26 - Numerics library
  P1720R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 28 - Localization library
  P1721R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 29 - Input/Output library
  P1722R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 30 - Regular Expression library
  P1723R0: Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 31 - Atomics library
  P1724R0: C++ Standard Library Issues to be moved in Cologne


The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.

Also on my TODO list is to attempt to implement some of the proposals that are coming up for a vote in July (flat_map, text formatting, etc).

Boost

The next Boost release cycle is in process; I am helping Michael Caisse as release manager with this release.

Conferences

Upcoming talks:

  C++ Russia is at the end of October in St. Petersburg.
  Meeting C++ is in mid-November in Berlin.


I have submitted a talk for CppCon in September, but I will not hear back about this for a month or two.

I submitted a talk for ACCU Autumn, which is in Belfast right after the WG21 meeting, but I haven’t heard back about that yet. In any case, I will be attending this conference, since it’s in the same hotel as the WG21 meeting, and starts two days after the WG21 meeting, and concludes right before Meeting C++.

          <p class='text-xxs'>This month I’ve been working on the following projects:

  Certify
  Boost.Beast
  Boost.Build


Certify
This month, I’ve worked on expanding the documentation of Certify, especially
the example and introduction parts. When looking through the documentation for
Boost.Build I found out it’s possible to import snippets from *.cpp files
into the documentation, which will allow me to make sure that snippets in
the documentation compile and are tested. I’ve also attempted cleaning up the
Certify build script to use the OpenSSL module in b2, but I ran into issues, so
I’ll have get back to this one in the future.

Don’t forget to star the repository: https://github.com/djarek/certify!

Boost.Beast
I’ve been able to complete the port of the Beast CI to Azure Pipelines and expand
the test matrix beyond what was tested in the existing CI infrastructure. Thanks
to the expanded concurrent job limit, a full run on AzP takes less time than a
full Travis and Appveyor build, especially when wait times are taken into accout.
One of the matrix items I added were tests for header-only no-deprecated builds,
which turned out to be broken. Untested code has a nasty tendency to rot.
I’ve also been able to identify some function templates in http::basic_fields
which could be turned into regular functions. One of them, was instantiated
4 times because they were passed a predicate which was a lambda expression.
These two changes turned out to be fairly significant, because they allowed
shaving off at least 10 KiB of binary size per instantiation (amd64, -O3).

Boost.Build
When working on the Azure Pipelines CI for Beast I noticed that b2 doesn’t support
the leak sanitizer, so I decided to add it. It’s available via the leak-sanitizer=on feature.

There was a lot of “infrastructure work” done on libc++ this month; a large cleanup of the test suite (still in progress), a bunch of work on debug mode for the library (also still in progress)

LWG issues resolved this month in libc++


  2960 sub_match::swap only swaps the base class

    Improved the behavior of the compiler intrinsic __is_base_of. Clang no longer generates an error when you ask about inheritance relationships with unions, even if the non-union class is incomplete. This intrinsic is used by libc++ to implement std::is_base_of.
  
  
    Fixed a few regex bugs, and improved the regex tests in C++03.

Boost

It’s been a quiet month for boost (except for C++ Now, the conference formerly known as BoostCon).

There are a couple of good trip reports for C++Now:

  Matthew Butler
  JeanHeyd Meneide


The next Boost release cycle is starting soon; with the deadline for new libraries coming up later this month. I’m hoping to mentor a new release manager with this release.

Conferences

Another travel month.  I spent a bunch of time away from home, but only one conference:


  At C++ Now in Aspen, CO, I presented “The View from a C++ Standard Library Implementor”, which was voted the runner-up for “Most Engaging” talk.


I have submitted a talk for CppCon in September, but I will not hear back about this for a month or two.

I have submitted talks for C++ Russia and Meeting C++, which are both very close (timewise) to the Belfast WG21 meeting, but I haven’t heard back yet.

I am looking forward to being at home for the entire month of June.

  Certify
  Boost.Beast
  Boost.Build
  BeastLounge


Certify
Certify did not have any platform-independent means of caching certificate
status (i.e. revoked, valid, unknown), so I implemented one. For now it has to
be manually filled, but I’ll add a way to import a static blacklist (somewhat
similar to the builtin blacklist in Chrome) and query the status of a
certificate. Unfortunately there is no way to handle OCSP stapling within the
verification callback invoked by OpenSSL which is quite detrimental to
usability. Additionally, OpenSSL doesn’t have a way of starting and waiting for
an asynchronous operation within callbacks (without blocking).

Don’t forget to star the repository: https://github.com/djarek/certify!

Boost.Beast
When working on making sure Beast is std::launder-correct, I ran into a number
of previously undiagnosed bugs in Beast. All of them have been fixed in
v254. I was quite confused
why these issues weren’t found by CI previously. I’ve been able to track it down
to old toolchain versions in Travis. Additionally, the test matrix lacks a few
fairly important variants. Considering the fact that Trusty is no longer
supported and the switch to Xenial is inevitable, I’ve decided to port over the
CI to Azure Pipelines, because it offers better concurrency which allows the
Beast CI to afford a larger test matrix. In the process I’ve also decided to use
as many default b2 options as possible, to make future changes to the CI easier.
There’s still an issue with Valgrind in Xenial to be resolved (doesn’t support
the RDRAND instruction).

Boost.Build
While working on the AzP CI for Beast, I found out that the coverage feature
in b2 doesn’t actually set build flags. coverage=all will now properly cause
tests to produce gcno and gcda files for consumption by the lcov tool.

BeastLounge
When experimenting with the BeastLounge application running on Heroku I found
out that Heroku’s router has a builtin 55s timeout which dropped websocket
connections. I solved the issue by making the websocket ping timeouts
configurable.

Also, there was a series of general cleanups in the libc++ tests to improve portability and readability. I added a bunch of updates for debug-mode, and there were several places where we assumed that string::compare returned -1/0/1 instead of what was specified, which is \&lt;0/0/\&gt;0.

Boost

We released Boost 1.70 on the 12th of April.

Once again, I was the release manager, which involved a bunch of “process management”; things like assembling the release candidates, packaging up release notes, deciding which problems that came up would be fixed (and which ones would not), and updating the web site (and so on, and so on).

Conferences

This was a big travel month.  I gave two presentations:


  
    At the LLVM European Developer’s conference in Brussels, I gave a 30 minute overview of the changes that were coming to the standard library for C++20.
  
  
    At ACCU in Bristol, England, I gave a talk titled “Navigating the development and evolution of a library”

Certify
Certify now properly verifies the hostname of a TLS server according to RFC 2818
or TLS-DANE if available. Additionally, initial support for CRLSets has been
merged, although it’s still missing integration into the verification code.

I’ve also invested a fair bit of time into researching what other open source
libraries do to perform certificate status checking. I’ve looked into BoringSSL,
mbedTLS, Botan and even the Go standard library. It’s interesting that no
library has a default way of performing the status check of a certificate and
it’s left up to the user.

The Windows implementation of the certificate store in Certify will now properly
use the entire chain passed by the peer, which resolves certificate failures in
less common cases.

Don’t forget to star the repository: https://github.com/djarek/certify!

Boost.Beast
Most of the work this month involved making Beast compile faster and use less
memory by expanding the code that can use split compilation and reducing redundant
dependencies in a few places.

Boost.Build
I’ve worked on implementing 2 improvements that make it less painful to work with b2:

  support for finding OpenSSL
  support for sanitizers in gcc and clang
Both are currently still in review.


BeastLounge
The project lacked functioning CI so I implemented one. Since the project was
previously only compiled on MSVC, this proved to be quite challenging, because
MSVC accepts code that is not valid C++11. I’ve also created a deplyoment docker
image, which allows running the application in popular cloud environments, like
Heroku. A development version of the app is available at https://beast-lounge.herokuapp.com/.

  Speaking at conferences


This month, I spent far more time reviewing other people’s code and preparing talks for conferences than the previous few months. The Boost release process consumed a fair chunk of time as well.

Libc++

The big news is: we released LLVM 8 this month! (March 20th). You can get the sources and pre-built binaries from the LLVM download page, or wait for your system vendor to provide you with an update.

As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.

LWG papers implemented this month.


  P0811 std::midpoint for integral and pointer types. This turned out to be quite involved, and spawned a clang bug report. On the plus side, now I have a topic for a talk for CppCon this fall.


Still to do, std::midpoint for floating point types. This is done, but it needs better tests.

LWG issues implemented this month


  I didn’t actually commit any LWG issue fixes this month. I worked with others on several bug fixes that landed, but not under my name.


LLVM features implemented this month (certainly incomplete)


  Add noexcept to operator[] for array and deque
  Mark vector::operator[] and front/back as noexcept
  Mark front() and back() as noexcept for array/deque/string/string_view
  Make to_chars/from_chars work back to C++11. This lets us use them in to_string.


LLVM bugs resolved this month (probably incomplete)


  Bug 35967 &lt;regex&gt; syntax_option_type is not a proper bitmask
  No bug # Fix a minor bug with std::next and prev not handling negative numbers.
  No bug # Cleanup of requirements for optional - we no longer allow optional&lt;const in_place_t&gt;
  Bug 41130 operator/ of std::chrono::duration and custom type.


Also, there was a series of general cleanups in the libc++ tests to improve portability and readability. Eric and I (mostly Eric) revamped the debug-mode support, and there will be more activity there in the future. Also, we’re moving towards using more of the ASSERT_XXXX macros for readability, and I revamped about 30 of the tests to use them. Only several thousand to go!

WG21

The “winter” WG21 meeting was held in Kona, HI on February 18-24. This was the last meeting for new features for C++20, and as such, it was both contentious and very busy.

Between now and the next meeting (July), LWG will be working on reviewing papers and issues to be adopted in July. We have had three teleconferences since Kona, and a fourth is scheduled for mid-April.

I am working on more “cleanup” papers similar to P1458 - Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 16 - Language support library, and my P0805 - Comparing Containers needs an update.

The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.

Boost

It’s time for another Boost release (1.70), and I am acting as the release manager again. The release calendar is available (as always) on the Boost website.

The cut-off for contributions for the release is 3-April, with a release candidate to follow close behind, and the actual release to happen on the 10th.

Once the release is over, I’ll be putting some serious time into Boost.Algorithm; there are a bunch of C++17/20 algorithms that can be added to the library (among other things).

Conferences

I had submitted talk proposals to three conferences, and all three were accepted.

I will be speaking at:


  LLVM European Developer’s Conference, April 8-9 in Brussels
  ACCU, April 10-13 in Bristol

          <p class='text-xxs'>Certify - X509 certificate validation
I always knew that validating a certificate chain presented by a peer is not an
easy procedure, but my recent work in Certify to port over the procedure from
Chromium has only proven that I underestimated the complexity of it. Certificate
revocation seems to be a particularly hard issue, with 2 main categories of
solutions - offline and online validation.

Online validation - OCSP
OCSP is a protocol designed to allow checking the revocation status of a
certificate by sending a request over a subset of HTTP/1.1. At first glance, it
seems it solves the status checking problem on its own. However, OCSP has
problems, inherent to online checking.

First of all, the validation server might not be currently available - so a lack
of response is most definitely not a state in which a chain can be trusted.
Secondly, the check may be slow, after all, it requires connecting to a separate
service. Additionally, the native Windows API for certificate verification does
the status check synchronously, which means potentially blocking a user’s thread
that typically services asynchronous operations. There is a feature that
alleviates most of these issues, at least from the point of view of a TLS
client, OCSP stapling. Sadly, it’s not very widespread and actually few large
services support it, due to the fact that it increases bandwidth requirements.
Certify will, at some point support both OCSP status checks on the client side
and support for OCSP stapling. The problem here is that OCSP requires a fairly
functional HTTP client and ASN.1 parsing. A lot of this functionality is already
present in OpenSSL, however, integrating it with ASIO and Beast may be tricky.

Offline validation - CRLs and Google CRLSets
The traditional method of checking the status of a certificate involves looking
up revocation lists installed in the OS’s store, or downloaded by the
application from the CA. Unfortunately CRLs have issues - an example would be an
incident from a few years ago when CloudFlare performed a mass revocation which
blew up the size of the CRLs by a few orders of magnitude, resulting in a
requirement to download multiple megabytes of data, turning CAs into a major
performance bottleneck. Google came up with a different mechanism, called
CRLSets, which involves a periodic download of a revocation list which is
created by Google’s crawler querying certificate status over OCSP. This
verification method is fairly attractive for applications that run on systems
that already have Google products, since this database is shared, which is why
I’ve chosen to provide an opt-in implementation in Certify. For now, updating
the database will be out of scope, because that requires a few utilties that are
missing from Boost at this time (XML, JSON and an HTTP Client).

          <p class='text-xxs'>Monthly update (or, what Marshall did in January and February)

There are four main areas where I spend my time.


  Libc++, where I am the “code owner”
  WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG)
  Boost
  Speaking at conferences


Libc++

The LLVM “branch for release” occurred in January, and there was a bit of a rush to get things into the LLVM 8 release. Now that is over, and we’re just watching the test results, seeing if anyone finds any problems with the release. I don’t anticipate any, but you never know.

As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.

After the branch, I started working on new features for the LLVM 9 release (for this summer). More calendaring stuff, new C++20 features, and some C++17 features that haven’t been done yet.

LWG papers implemented in Jan/Feb


  P0355: Extending  to Calendars and Time Zones. You may remember this from last month's update; this is a huge paper, and I am landing it in stages.
  P1024: tuple-like interface to span
  P1227: Signed ssize() functions
  P1357: Traits for [Un]bounded Arrays


LWG issues implemented in Jan/Feb (certainly incomplete)


  LWG3101: span’s Container constructors need another constraint
  LWG3144: span does not have a const_pointer typedef
  Enabled a memcpy optimization for const vectors that was surprisingly missing


LLVM bugs resolved in Jan/Feb (probably incomplete)


  Bug 28412 std::vector incorrectly requires CopyConstructible, Destructible and other concepts
  Bug 39183 tuple comparison operators return true for tuples of different sizes
  Bug 24411 libFuzzer outputs that crash libc++’s regex engine
  Bug 34330 error: use of undeclared identifier ‘isascii’ while compiling strstream.cpp
  Bug 38606 no_sanitize(“unsigned-integer-overflow”) annotation for decremented size_type in __hash_table
  Bug 40533 std::minmax_element is 3 times slower than hand written loop
  Bug 18584 SD-6 Feature Test Recommendations
  Bug 40566 Libc++ is not Implicit Integer Truncation Sanitizer clean
  Bug 21715 128-bit integers printing not supported in stl implementation
  Bug 38844 __cpp_lib_make_unique not defined in &lt;memory&gt;
  Bug 40495 is_invokable_v&lt;void&gt; does not compile
  Bug 40270 std::basic_stringstream is not working with std::byte
  Bug 39871 std::tuple_size should be a struct
  Bug 38052 std::fstream still good after closing and updating content


Also, there was a series of general cleanups in the libc++ tests to improve portability.

The current status of libc++ can be found here:

  C++20 status
  C++17 status
  C++14 status (Complete)
  Libc++ open bugs


WG21

The “winter” WG21 meeting was held in Kona, HI on February 18-24. This was the last meeting for new features for C++20, and as such, it was both contentious and very busy.

The Modules TS and the Coroutines TS were both adopted for C++20, along with a slew of language features.

Here are some trip reports:

  Herb Sutter
  Bryce Adelstein Lelbach
  Guy Davidson


My part in this was (as always) to chair the Library Working Group (LWG), the group responsible for the description of the library features in the standard (~1000 pages).
We adopted several new features for C++20:


  P0339R6 polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt; as a vocabulary type
  P0340R3 Making std::underlying_type SFINAE-friendly
  P0738R2 I Stream, You Stream, We All Stream for istream_iterator
  P0811R3 Well-behaved interpolation for numbers and pointers
  P0920R2 Precalculated hash values in lookup
  P1001R2 Target Vectorization Policies from Parallelism V2 TS to C++20
  P1024R3 Usability Enhancements for std::span
  P1164R1 Make create_directory() Intuitive
  P1227R2 Signed ssize() functions, unsigned size() functions
  P1252R2 Ranges Design Cleanup
  P1357R1 Traits for [Un]bounded Arrays


I wrote five substantive papers for the Kona meeting, all were adopted. Five of them were very similar, all about improving the wording in the standard, rather than proposing new features.


  P1458 Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 16 - Language support library
  P1459 Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 18 - Diagnostics library
  P1462 Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 20 - Strings library
  P1463 Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 21 - Containers library
  P1464 Mandating the Standard Library: Clause 22 - Iterators library


I was also the nominal author of P1457 “C++ Standard Library Issues to be moved in Kona”, but that was just a list of issues whose resolutions we adopted.

Between now and the next meeting (July), LWG will be working on reviewing papers and issues to be adopted in July. I’m planning regular teleconferences (in fact, we had the first one on 1-March).

The goal of the July meeting is to have a “Committee Draft” (CD) of the proposed C++20 standard that can be sent out for review.

Boost

It’s been a quiet couple of months for Boost, since we’re between releases, and I have been busy with libc++ and WG21 activities. There have been a few bugs to chase down, and the dealing with change requests for the libraries whose maintainers have “moved on” takes some time.

However, it’s time for another Boost release (1.70), and I will be acting as the release manager again. The release calendar is available (as always) on the Boost website.

The beta release is schedule for March 13th, and the final release for 10-April.

Conferences

I had submitted talk proposals to three conferences, and all three were accepted. Hence, I will be speaking at:


  LLVM European Developer’s Conference, April 8-9 in Brussels
  ACCU, April 10-13 in Bristol
  CppNow, May 5-10 in Aspen, CO

          <p class='text-xxs'>Monthly update (or, what Marshall did in December)

There are three main areas where I spend my time.


  Boost
  Libc++
  WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG)



Boost:
December was a big month for boost, and much of the first part of the month was taken up with the release process. I was the release manager for the 1.69.0 release, which went live on 12-December. The final release process was fairly straighforward, with only one release candidate being made/tested - as opposed to the beta, which took three. In any case, we had a successful release, and the I (and other boost developers) are now happily working on features/bug fixes for the 1.70 release - which will occur in March.


Libc++:
After the WG21 meeting in November, there was a bunch of new functionality to be added to libc++. The list of new features (and their status) can be seen on the libc++ website.  My major contributions of new features in December were Consistent Container Erasure, char8_t: A type for UTF-8 characters and strings, and Should Span be Regular?, and a big chunk of [Extending  to Calendars and Time Zones](https://wg21.link/P0355R7).

This is all pointing towards the January 16th “branch for release”, and for the scheduled March release of LLVM 8.0.

As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never ending task; there are new contributions ever day.


WG21

Being between meetings (November -&gt; February) there was not any special WG21 work to be done in December. There’s an ongoing stream of bug reports, discussion, paper reviews that get done between meetings, and there is a series of papers that I need to finish for the pre-Meeting mailing deadline on 21-January. I have 1 1/2 done, and need to do 3-4 more.

          <p class='text-xxs'>WG21 San Diego Meeting

Last week was the fall 2018 WG21 standard committee meeting. It was held
in San Diego, which is my hometown. The fact that I helped organize it
(while I was working at Qualcomm) had absolutely no affect on the location,
I assure you. ;-)

This was the largest WG21 meeting ever, with 180 attendees. The last meeting
(in Rapperswil, Switzerland) had about 150 attendees, and that was the
largest one until now. There were more than 270 papers in the pre-meeting
mailing; meaning that people were spending weeks reading papers to prepare
for the meeting. Herb Sutter (the convener) has been telling everyone that
new papers received after the San Diego meeting were out of scope for C++20,
and apparently people took him at his word.

This was my first meeting representing the C++ Alliance (though hardly my
first overall). The Alliance was well represented, with Rene, Glen, Vinnie,
Jon and myself attending. For information about how WG21 is structured,
please see isocpp.org.

I spent all of my time in LWG, since that’s the group that I chair, and the
one that has the most influence over libc++, the library that I work on.

The big news from a library POV was that we voted to merge an updated paper
based on the Ranges TS into the draft standard; which means that (barring
catastrophe) that it will be part of C++20. This was a huge paper, weighing
in at 220+ pages. We spent several days in LWG reviewing this (and a bunch
of time at previous meetings as well).

We also moved a bunch (around 25) of smaller papers; too many to list here.

Detailed trip reports can be found around the web:

The next WG21 meeting is in Kona, HI February 18-23rd.

          <p class='text-xxs'>Initial work on Certify complete
It’s been mentioned in my initial blog post that I’d be working on a TLS
certificate store abstraction library, with the intent of submitting it for
formal review for Boost, at some point in the (hopefully near) future.
The initial setup phase (things that every Software Engineer hates) is more
or less complete. CI setup was a bit tricky - getting OpenSSL to run with
the boost build system on both Windows and Linux (and in the future MacOS)
has provided a lot of “fun” thanks to the inherent weirdness of OpenSSL.

The test harness currently consists of two test runners that loads certificates
from a database (big name for a folder structure stored in git) that has the
certificate chains divided into two groups. Chains that will fail due to various
reasons (e.g. self-signed certificates, wrong domain name) and ones that will pass
(when using a valid certificate store). I’m still working on checking whether
the failure was for the expected reason. All the verification is done offline
(i.e. no communication with external servers is performed, only chain verification).

At this point it looks like I should consider, whether the current design of
the verification code is a good approach. Using the verification callback
from OpenSSL and asio::ssl is quite an easy way of integrating the platform-specific
certificate store API it causes issues with error propagation (transporting a platform-specific
error through OpenSSL) and may be fairly slow, because it requires certificates to be
reencdoded into the DER format so that they can be fed into the platform-specific API.
An alternative to this approach would be load the entire root certificate store, along with CRLs and
OCSP configuration into an OpenSSL context. This is potentially a little bit harder to get right but
may offer better performance (no reencoding required when veryfing certificate chains) and eliminates
the issues related to error handling. Further investigation, as to which approach is better, is required.
